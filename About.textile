*Gollum* combines a git-aware webserver with a text processor to generate HTML from more lightweight, easy-to-read markup languages like "markdown":http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/ and "textile":http://redcloth.org/textile.

A read-only version, "smeagol":https://github.com/rubyworks/smeagol, removes the edit functionality and is suitable for public hosting.

Language-specific cheat sheets are available in edit mode, via the *?* button.
