h3. "gollum":https://github.com/github/gollum

*Gollum* combines a git-aware webserver with a text processor to generate HTML from more lightweight, easy-to-read markup languages like "markdown":http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/ and "textile":http://redcloth.org/textile.

A read-only version, "smeagol":https://github.com/rubyworks/smeagol, removes the edit functionality and would be suitable for hosting.

Language-specific cheat sheets are available in edit mode, via the "?" button.

Gollum seems to have trouble saving new files.  I guess some dependencies might be out of date.

Files can, of course, be edited locally by cloning the git repository.  Changes must be committed before gollum will pick them up.

Source-code highlighting.
