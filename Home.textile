h2. About

h3. "gollum":https://github.com/github/gollum

*Gollum* combines a git-aware webserver with a text processor to generate HTML from more lightweight, easy-to-read markup languages like "markdown":http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/ and "textile":http://redcloth.org/textile.

A read-only version, "smeagol":https://github.com/rubyworks/smeagol, removes the edit functionality and would be suitable for hosting.

Language-specific cheat sheets are available in edit mode, via the "?" button.

h3. "pygments":http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/

Source-code highlighting.

h3. "pandoc":https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-vs-Multimarkdown

Translate one markup syntax to another.
